## Smart Traffic Commercial Billboard Electronics Project

### Description

Efficient traffic management is crucial for societal development. Inadequate transportation systems can lead to significant time wastage and hinder a country's growth. This project aims to address traffic management challenges by implementing an intelligent LED billboard system capable of manual and automatic control. It will display messages to manage traffic flow, provide lane-specific information, and aid in emergency situations.

### Features

- **Android App Integration**: Communicate messages to the LED billboard using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
- **Opposite Lane Block Detection**: Utilize motion sensors to identify blockages and suggest alternative routes.
- **Automated Transportation Management**: Control billboard messages manually or automatically via apps.
- **Emergency Sound Detection**: Activate emergency alerts on the billboard during critical situations.
- **GPS Tracker Integration**: Transmit emergency location details to mobile devices via communication modules.
